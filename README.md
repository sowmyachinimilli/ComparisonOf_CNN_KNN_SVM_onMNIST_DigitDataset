# Comparison of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), KNN and SVM on MNIST Digit Dataset

Implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras API on MNIST dataset with an accuracy of 99%.
 
Evaluated the model using k-fold cross validation and Confusion Matrix.
 
Built an improved CNN model by changing hyper-parameters and network architecture to get better image classification and visualized the accuracy and loss graphs using Matplotlib for evaluating the models because of which the accuracy improved by more than 1 %.
 
KNN, SVM and CNN models were compared and improved CNN was found out to give the best accuracy
